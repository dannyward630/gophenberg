Feature: A role decides which routes an account reaches
  A site owner hands out accounts that write without handing over the
  keys to the site, and accounts for members who never enter the admin.
  Each administration area answers only a role carrying its capability,
  the content routes answer every role carrying access_admin, and a
  member keeps only its own session and language.
