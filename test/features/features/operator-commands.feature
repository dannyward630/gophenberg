Feature: Operators run Gophenberg from one command line
  An operator runs every task through the gophenberg command. A run with
  no command lists what the program offers, a change is only a preview
  until the operator confirms it, and a change to an account names the
  administrator who makes it and is kept on record.

  Background:
    Given the settings point at an empty database

  Scenario: A run with no command lists every command
    When the operator runs gophenberg with no command
    Then the command succeeds
    And the answer lists the commands "serve", "migrate", "seed" and "account:create-admin"
    And the database holds no schema

  Scenario Outline: A command name from before the command line is refused
    When the operator runs "<name>"
    Then the command exits with code 2
    And the answer names the unknown command "<name>"

    Examples:
      | name        |
      | createadmin |
      | grantrole   |

  Scenario: A help page answers without a database
    Given the settings name no database
    When the operator asks for the help page of "account:role"
    Then the command succeeds
    And the answer describes "account:role"

  Scenario: About tells what this binary is without a database
    Given the settings name no database
    When the operator runs "about -json"
    Then the command succeeds
    And the answer names the version, the build stamp, the minimum version and the theme kits of this binary

  Scenario: About names the lowest Node.js major
    Given the settings name no database
    When the operator runs "about -json"
    Then the command succeeds
    And the answer names Node.js 24 as the lowest major a theme runs on

  Scenario: Migrating stores the minimum version of this binary
    When the operator runs "migrate"
    Then the command succeeds
    And the database holds the minimum version of this binary

  Scenario: Migrating raises an older minimum version to the one of this binary
    Given a Gophenberg migrated the database and left the minimum version "0.0.1"
    When the operator runs "migrate"
    Then the command succeeds
    And the database holds the minimum version of this binary

  Scenario: A database a newer Gophenberg migrated stops the migration
    Given a Gophenberg migrated the database and left the minimum version "99.0.0"
    When the operator runs "migrate"
    Then the command exits with code 1
    And the error says "this database needs Gophenberg 99.0.0 or newer"
    And the database still holds the minimum version "99.0.0"

  Scenario: A check finds a newer version in the signed index
    Given an update site whose stable index offers version "99.0.0"
    When the operator runs "update:check -json"
    Then the command succeeds
    And the answer offers version "99.0.0"

  Scenario: A check finds nothing newer than this binary
    Given an update site whose stable index offers version "0.0.1"
    When the operator runs "update:check -json"
    Then the command succeeds
    And the answer offers no version

  Scenario Outline: A key list signed by <root> alone is taken
    Given an update site whose stable index offers version "99.0.0"
    And only <root> signed the key list
    When the operator runs "update:check -json"
    Then the command succeeds
    And the answer offers version "99.0.0"

    Examples:
      | root            |
      | the first root  |
      | the second root |

  Scenario Outline: A check refuses <case>
    Given an update site whose stable index offers version "99.0.0"
    And <change>
    When the operator runs "update:check"
    Then the command exits with code 1
    And the error says "<error>"

    Examples:
      | case                                          | change                                                   | error                                                                          |

      | an index for another channel                  | the index names the channel "beta"                       | the site asks for                                                              |
      | a key list with no timestamp key              | the key list names no timestamp key                      | which names no timestamp key                                                   |
      | a key list naming one key under two roles     | the key list names the release key as its timestamp key  | names one key as its release key and its timestamp key                         |
      | a timestamp file that expired                 | the timestamp file expired yesterday                     | refused the timestamp file, which expired at                                   |
      | a missing timestamp file                      | the update site serves no timestamp file                 | timestamp.json: the site answered 404                                          |
      | a timestamp file naming a newer index         | the timestamp file names a newer index                   | refused the index of serial 2, older than serial 3 the timestamp file names    |
      | a timestamp file naming a newer key list      | the timestamp file names a newer key list                | refused the key list of serial 1, older than serial 2 the timestamp file names |
      | a timestamp file the release key signed       | only the release key signed the timestamp file           | no timestamp key the list names signed it                                      |
      | an index the timestamp key signed             | only the timestamp key signed the index                  | no release or standby key the list names                                       |
      | a timestamp file with no line for the channel | the timestamp file names no index of the channel         | which names no index of channel                                                |

  Scenario Outline: A check takes <case>
    Given an update site whose stable index offers version "99.0.0"
    And <change>
    When the operator runs "update:check -json"
    Then the command succeeds
    And the answer offers version "99.0.0"

    Examples:
      | case                                                          | change                                                  |
      | an index older than 30 days that a fresh timestamp file names | the index was signed 40 days ago and expires in 50 days |
      | an index newer than the one the timestamp file names          | the timestamp file names an older index                 |

  Scenario: A check refuses an index older than the one it took before
    Given an update site whose stable index offers version "99.0.0"
    And the operator ran "update:check"
    And the update site went back to an older index
    When the operator runs "update:check"
    Then the command exits with code 1
    And the error says "older than serial"

  Scenario: A database a newer Gophenberg migrated stops an account command
    Given a Gophenberg migrated the database and left the minimum version "99.0.0"
